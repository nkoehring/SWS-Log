One project I'm totally looking forward to is Neovim. Beeing totally in love with VIM as editor is
one thing, but this love is not blind! VIM is now more than twenty years old, also supporting legacy
systems is nice and all but lets face it: at least 95% of the users are not on an Amiga or MSDOS
anymore.

Read the "fundraiser page":https://www.bountysource.com/fundraisers/539-neovim-first-iteration for
more information, if you are interested. "tarruda":http://tarruda.github.io did a great job in
explaining in every detail, what he plans to do, so it's worth reading it.

The fundraiser reached its $10000 goal after less than 48 hours, by the way. Thats massive!
