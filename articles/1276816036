I am a huge fan of webcomics. Who isn't? So I thought about made my favorites public.

Here they are:

  * "xkcd":http://xkcd.com
    »A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language.«
    Yeah, I love it!

  * "Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic":http://yafgc.net
    Great fantasy comic with a lot of nice allusions.

  * "Walking The Lethe":http://walkingthelethe.com
    Nice dark fantasy comic with demons and angels but in modern time.

  * "Death and the Maiden":http://deathandmaiden.com
    Nice comic about Death and a …yes you guess it… a maiden.

  * "Zahra's Paradise":http://www.zahrasparadise.com
    I already wrote about this comic. It's quite different from the others because it tells a real story about real issues in the Iran. It's NOT funny. But it's absolutely worth to be read!

There are more webcomics or related websites which I don't read frequently. For example "Abstruse Goose":http://abstrusegoose.com and "theOatmeal":http://theoatmeal.com/comics.

Thats it!
