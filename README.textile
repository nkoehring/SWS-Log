h1. SWS Weblog

A very simple static weblog, using Javascript to look dynamic.

V2 is a complete rewrite. The feature set doesn't changed but the code is way
cleaner and has less dependencies. The pure javascript codebase with
dependencies is now shrinked from about 136k to 64k. I ditched jQuery in favour
of right.js and completely renounced any MVC library (aka sammy.js).
